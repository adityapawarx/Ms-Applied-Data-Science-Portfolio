# Movie Production Data Analysis Project

## Description

This project, developed by Group Zimin for IST 659, focuses on applying data analysis techniques to solve common problems in the movie-making industry during the pre-production phase. The primary goal is to assist producers in the pre-screening process by analyzing various factors such as expenses, selection of actors, crew members, and filming locations to ensure efficient budget allocation for film projects.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- SQL Database Management System
- Power BI for data visualization
- Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and American Film Institute (AFI) for reference data

### Installation

No specific installation steps are required for accessing the project's outputs, as it mainly involves data stored in SQL databases and visualized through Power BI. However, accessing the detailed database and visual reports might require:

1. SQL Server or a similar DBMS to review the database structure and queries.
2. Power BI Desktop for opening and interacting with the visual reports.

### Usage

The project allows users to:
- Analyze the range of expenses for different movie genres.
- Identify actors and crew members suitable for specific genres within budget constraints.
- Explore filming locations that offer cost advantages.
- Utilize Power BI dashboards for interactive exploration of movie data, including location maps, genre-specific budgets, and detailed movie information.
